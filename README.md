# Profiler

Profiler is a plugin for Minecraft servers which tracks relevant user data and stores it in a database. It allows server admins to keep track of the usernames which 
players use and to add notes to their profiles as a permanent record on a player's behaviour.

## Building
Profiler uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

#### Compiling from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Will-Gould/Profiler.git

```
